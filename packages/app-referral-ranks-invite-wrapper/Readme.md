# Dev instructions
This package locally uses [localtunnel](https://localtunnel.github.io/www/) which provides a generated link that can be used to test OG tags in Discord (since we cannot use localhost).

Using `yarn start` in between the output should be a link saying `your url is <url>`. This link can be used to try OG tags.
